This serves everyone's best interests, by ensuring that customers receive comprehensive, high-quality patches for security vulnerabilities but are not exposed to malicious users while the patch is being developed.

The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your copyright complaint under penalty of perjury. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration (18 U.S.C \u00a7 1621). Submitting false information could also result in civil liability -- that is, you could get sued for monetary damages.</p> <p>Investigate. Submitting a DMCA counter notice can have real legal consequences. If the complaining party disagrees that their takedown notice was mistaken, they might decide to file a lawsuit against you to keep the content disabled. You should conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations made in the takedown notice and probably talk to a lawyer before submitting a counter notice.</p> <p>You Must Have a Good Reason to Submit a Counter Notice. In order to file a counter notice, you must have \"a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\" (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(g).) Whether you decide to explain why you believe there was a mistake is up to you and your lawyer, but you do need to identify a mistake before you submit a counter notice. Examples include: the complaining party doesn't have the copyright; I have a license; or the complaint doesn't account for the fact that my use is protected by the fair-use doctrine. Of course, there could be other defects with the takedown notice.</p> <p>Copyright Laws Are Complicated. Sometimes a takedown notice might allege infringement in a way that seems odd or indirect. Copyright laws are complicated and can lead to some unexpected results. </p> <p>A Counter Notice Is A Legal Statement. We require you to fill out all fields of a counter notice completely because a counter notice is a legal statement -- not just to us, but to the complaining party. As we mentioned above, if the complaining party wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the content on the LuzFaltex Projects. In other words, you might get sued (and you consent to that in the counter notice).</p> <p>Your Counter Notice Will Be Published. As noted in our DMCA Takedown Policy, after redacting your personal information, we will publish all complete and actionable counter notices at https://github.com/LuzFaltex/DMCA/. Please also note that, although we will only publicly publish redacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it. If you are concerned about your privacy, you may have a lawyer or other legal representative file the counter notice on your behalf.</p> <p>LuzFaltex Isn't The Judge. LuzFaltex exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under the penalty of perjury.</p> <p>Additional Resources.

Because of that, we ask that you conduct a thorough investigation and consult with an attorney before submitting a takedown to make sure the use isn't actually permissible.</p> <p>Ask Nicely First. A great step before sending us a takedown notice is to try contacting the user directly. They may have listed contact information on their public profile page.

If you have a complaint about trademark abuse, please see our trademark policy. If you are dealing with defamation or other abusive behavior, please see our Code of Conduct.</p> <p>No Bots. You should have a trained professional valuate the facts of every takedown notice you send.

These complaints are often invalid and processing them results in needlessly taking down content!</p> <p>Matters of Copyright are Hard. It can be very difficult to determine whether or not a particular work is protected by copyright. For example, facts (including data) are generally not copyrightable. Words and short phrases are generally not copyrightable. URLs and domain names are generally not copyrightable. Since you can only use the DMCA process to target content that is protected by copyright, you should speak with a lawyer if you have questions about whether or not your content is protectable.</p> <p>You May Receive a Counter Notice.

This information is important because it helps the affected user evaluate your claim and give them the ability to compare your work to theirs. The specificity of your identification will depend on the nature of the work you believe has been infringed. If you have published your work, you might be able to just link back to a web page where it lives. IF it is proprietary and not published, you might describe it and explain that it is proprietary.

Since even a single claim of copyright infringement can carry statutory damages of up to $150,000, the possibility of being held liable for user-generated content could be very harmful for service providers. With potential damages multiplied across millions of users, cloud-computing and user-generated content sites like YouTube, Facebook, or GitHub probably never would have existed without the DMCA (or at least not without passing some of that cost downstream to their users).</p> <p>The DMCA addresses this issue by creating a copyright liability safe harbor for internet service providers hosting allegedly infringing user-generated content. Essentially, so long as a service provider follows the DMCA's notice-and-takedown rules, it won't be liable for copyright infringement based on user-generated content. Because of this, it is important for LuzFaltex to maintain its DMCA safe-harbor status.</p>"},{"location":"policies/dmca/#dmca-notices-in-a-nutshell","title":"DMCA Notices in a Nutshell","text":"<p>The DMCA provides two simple, straightforward procedures that all LuzFaltex users should know about: (i) a takedown-notice procedure for copyright holders to request that content be removed; and (ii) a counter-notice procedure for users to get content reenabled when content is taken down by mistake or misidentification.</p> <p>DMCA takedown notices are used by copyright owners to ask LuzFaltex to take down content they believe to be infringing. If you are a software designer or developer, you create copyrighted content every day. If someone else is using your copyrighted content in an unauthorized manner on a LuzFaltex Community, you can send us a DMCA takedown notice to request that the infringing content be changed or removed.</p> <p>On the other hand, counter notices can be used to correct mistakes. Maybe the person sending the takedown notice does not hold the copyright or did not realize that you have a license or made some other mistake in their takedown notice. Since LuzFaltex usually cannot know if there has been a mistake, the DMCA counter notice allows you to let us know and ask that we put the content back up.</p> <p>The DMCA notice and takedown process should be used only for complaints about copyright infringement. Notices sent through our DMCA process must identify copyrighted work or works that are allegedly being infringed. The process cannot be used for other complaints, such as complaints about alleged trademark infringement or sensitive data; we offer separate processes for those situations.</p>"},{"location":"policies/dmca/#how-does-this-actually-work","title":"How does this actually work?","text":"<p>The DMCA framework is a bit like passing notes in class. The copyright owner hands LuzFaltex a complaint about a user. If it's written correctly, we pass the complaint along to the user. If the user disputes the complaint, they can pass a note back saying so. LuzFaltex exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. If is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under the penalty of perjury.</p> <p>Here are the basic steps in the process.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Copyright Owner Investigates. A copyright owner should always conduct an initial investigation to confirm bot (a) that they own the copyright to an original work and (b) that the content on the Community is unauthorized and infringing. This includes confirming that the use is not protected as fair use. A particular use may be fair if it only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some combination of the above.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copyright Owner Sends A Notice. After conducting an investigation, a copyright owner prepares and sends a takedown notice to LuzFaltex. Assuming the takedown notice is sufficiently detailed according to the statutory requirements (as explained in the how-to guide), we will post the notice to our public repository and pass the link along to the affected user.</p> </li> <li> <p>LuzFaltex Asks User to Make Changes. If the notice alleges that the entire contents of a thread, post, or other content infringe, we will skip to step 6 and hide the entire thread or post expeditiously. Otherwise, we will contact a user who created the content and give them approximately 1 business day to delete or modify the content specified in the notice. We'll notify the copyright owner if and when we give the user a chance to make changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>User Notifies LuzFaltex of Changes. If the user chooses to make the specified changes, they must tell us so within the window of approximately 1 business day. If they don't, we'll hide the content (as described in step 6). If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will verify that the changes have been made and then notify the copyright owner.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copyright Owner Revises or Retracts the Notice. If the user makes changes, the copyright owner must review them and renew or revise their takedown notice if the changes are insufficient. LuzFaltex will not take any further action unless the copyright owner contacts us to either renew the original takedown notice or submit a revised one. IF the copyright owner is satisfied with the changes, they may either submit a formal retraction or else do nothing. LuzFaltex will interpret silence longer than two weeks as an implied retraction of the takedown notice.</p> </li> <li> <p>LuzFaltex May Disable Access To the Content. LuzFaltex will disable the user's content if: (i) the copyright owner has alleged copyright over the user's entire content; (ii) the user has not made any changes after being given an opportunity to do so (as noted in step 4); or (iii) the copyright owner has renewed their takedown notice after the user has had a chance to make changes. If the copyright owner chooses instead to revise the notice, we will go back to step 2 and repeat the process as if the revised notice were a new notice.</p> </li> <li> <p>User May Send A Counter Notice. We encourage users who have had content disabled to consult a lawyer about their options. If a user believes that their content was disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification, they may send us a counter notice. As with the original notice, we will make sure that the counter notice is sufficiently detailed (as explained in the how-to guide). If it is, we will post it to our public repository and pass the notice back to the copyright owner by sending them a link.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copyright Owner May File a Legal Action. If a copyright owner wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate legal action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on our Communities. In other words, you might get sued. If the copyright owner does not give LuzFaltex notice within 10-14 days by sending a copy of a valid legal complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction, LuzFaltex will re-enable the disabled content.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"policies/dmca/#what-if-i-inadvertently-missed-the-window-to-make-changes","title":"What If I Inadvertently Missed the Window to Make Changes?","text":"<p>We recognize that there are many valid reasons that you may not be able to make changes within the window of approximately 1 business day we provide before your content gets disabled.

Most of our communities will let the poster edit hidden content. However, if this is not the case, just respond to let us know that you would have liked to make changes and we will re-enable the content one additional time for approximately 1 business day to allow you to make changes.
